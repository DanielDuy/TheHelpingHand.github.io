            <p>Med vår nyeste innovasjon, så har vår smartklokke muligheten til å hindre fravær fra elever som ikke har muligheten til å møte opp på skolen. Ved å kun bruke en mobil-app eller et armbånd, så kan du sjekke inn på hver time på en fysisk scanner, som ligger ved inngangen i vært klasserom. Timene vil blir tatt opp, samt med relevante temaer, som lærerne legger ut i systemet. Skulle det hende at eleven ikke scanner deg inn til timen, vil eleven fortsatt ha muligheten til å ta igjen alt han eller henne gikk glipp av. </p>

                        In late 2010, my best friends Sean, Aaron and I decided to move to China to start designing and manufacturing our own products. Sure, there were more than enough watches already being mass-produced, but unfortunately, far too many of them were made with a focus on cutting corners and keeping costs as low as possible. What we envisioned was a vertical supply chain that could deliver unrivaled value and a small batch manufacturing process that could ensure quality.
                        Over the next 4 years, we cut our teeth learning to source our own raw materials, hire in-house quality control teams and design products we could produce efficiently. In 2014 we started Vincero with a very simple mission: to make products without taking shortcuts, for the people who refuse to take them.
                        Thankfully, we found a like-minded community, and thanks to your support we’re still independent and having the time of our lives.

                        n the beginning, we were intrigued by the intricacies of a watch — the efficiency needed to create such complicated pieces while at the same time keeping costs in check. There are amazing high end watches on the market that offer unrivaled quality. There are also affordable watches that are cheap and low quality. Our goal was to deliver the middle ground we believed was missing. Solid, well-made products delivered at an unrivaled value. Every time you receive one of our products we want you to feel like you got more than what you paid for.
                        This hasn’t proven to be easy. We’ve been humbled many times by our own mistakes. But now we’re starting to get the hang of it. Our products aren't perfect, but five years and dozens of revisions later, they’re getting a little closer. Since starting with just a dress watch, we’ve added dozens of more products to the Vincero arsenal including sunglasses, bracelets, and a customer base who are as loyal and as passionate about quality and a modern aesthetic as we are.
