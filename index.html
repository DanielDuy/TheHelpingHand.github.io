                    With our latest innovation, using only a mobile app or a wristband, you can check in every hour on a physical scanner, located at the entrance to our classroom. Our mission is to prevent students from staying home during school. The lessons will be recorded for later study, as well as with relevant topics, which the teachers can post in the system via the school network. Should the student not scan you into class, the student will still have the opportunity to catch up on everything he or she missed.

                    Our main goal with The Helping Wristband is to make the daily lives of students much easier by preventing absences for those who do not have the opportunity to attend school. We are a small team of 2, who are working on this project.
