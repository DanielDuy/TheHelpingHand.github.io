                    With our latest innovation, using only a mobile app or a wristband, you can check in every hour on a physical scanner, 
                    located at the entrance to our classroom. Our mission is to prevent students from staying home during school. 
                    The lessons will be recorded for later study, as well as with relevant topics, 
                    which the teachers can post in the system via the school network. Should the student not scan you into class, 
                    the student will still have the opportunity to catch up on everything he or she missed.

                        Our main goal with The Helping Wristband is to make the daily lives of students much easier by 
                        preventing absences for those who do not have the opportunity to attend school. We are a small team of 2, 
                        who are working on this project.

                        With the help by the app or the website, will students learn from anywhere. Either by a computer, ipad or phones. 
                        They can access their schedule and homework, in addition to watch the lesson via livestream or the recorded later.
                        This is really a form of homeschool system, that will help the students keep up with the school program, 
                        even if they have to stay home or cannot come to school on that particular day.

                        What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.
