                    With our latest innovation, using only a mobile app or a wristband, you can check in every hour on a physical scanner, 
                    located at the entrance to our classroom. Our mission is to prevent students from staying home during school. 
                    The lessons will be recorded for later study, as well as with relevant topics, 
                    which the teachers can post in the system via the school network. Should the student not scan you into class, 
                    the student will still have the opportunity to catch up on everything he or she missed.

                        Our main goal with The Helping Wristband is to make the daily lives of students much easier by 
                        preventing absences for those who do not have the opportunity to attend school. We are a small team of 2, 
                        who are working on this project.

                        With the help by the app or the website, will students learn from anywhere. Either by a computer, ipad or phones. 
                        They can access their schedule and homework, in addition to watch the lesson via livestream or the recorded later.
                        This is really a form of homeschool system, that will help the students keep up with the school program, 
                        even if they have to stay home or cannot come to school on that particular day.

                        The app will be avaliable in the appstore so you can download it and recieve notifications. It will frequently recieve updates to make the user interference better and children friendly.
                        The app will pretty much look like the website with touch properties.
                        If the student doesnt either have a phone or a smartwatch, they will get a bracelett they can use to scan in, that is connected to their studen profile on the website.
